# Quick Start for Markdown users

Djot is a lot like Markdown.  Here are some of the main
differences you need to be aware of in making the transition.

#### Blank lines

In djot you generally need blank lines around block-level
elements.  Hence, instead of

```
This is some text.
## My next heading
```

you must write

```
This is some text.

## My next heading
```

Instead of

```
Text.
> a blockquote.
```

you must write

```
Text.

> a blockquote.
```

And instead of

```
Before a thematic break.
****
After a thematic break.
```

you must write

```
Before a thematic break.

****

After a thematic break.
```

#### Lists

A special case of this is that you always need a blank line before a
list, even if it's a sublist. So, while in Markdown you can write

```
- one
  - two
  - three
```

in djot you must write

```
- one

  - two
  - three
```

#### Headings

There are no Setext-style (underlined) headings, only ATX- (`#`) style.

#### Code blocks

There are no indented code blocks, only fenced with ` ``` `.

#### Block quotes

You need a space after the `>` character, unless it is followed
by a newline.

#### Emphasis

Use single `_` delimiters for regular emphasis and
single `*` delimiters for strong emphasis.

#### Links

There is no special syntax for adding a title to a link, as
in Markdown:

```
[link](http://example.com "Go to my website")
```

If you want a title attribute on a link, use the general attribute syntax:

```
[link](http://example.com){title="Go to my website"}
```

#### Raw HTML

In Markdown you can just insert raw HTML "as is."  In djot,
you must mark it as raw HTML:

````
This is raw HTML: `<a id="foo">`{=html}.

Here is a raw HTML block:

``` =html
<table>
<tr><td>foo</td></tr>
</table>
```
````

#### Tables

Pipe tables always require a pipe character at the start and end
of each line, unlike in many Markdown implementations.  So, this
is not a table:

```
a|b
-|-
1|2
```

but this is:

```
| a | b |
| - | - |
| 1 | 2 |
```

#### That's enough to get started!

Here we have just focused on things that might trip up
Markdown users.  If you keep these in mind, you should be
able to start using djot without looking at any more
documentation.

However, we haven't discussed any of the things
you can do in djot but not Markdown.. See the [syntax
description](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jgm/djot/blob/master/doc/syntax.html)
to find about about the new constructions that are available.
